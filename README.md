This Cardio Tracker allows users to create a personal account that allows them to
track their workouts.  They can describe their workout, add a duration time,
add a distance, and write any notes they would like.  User workouts are tied
to a specific date, but users can have multiple workouts on a given date.

Users can update and delete past workouts, as well as search for workouts
on a specific date.

I wanted users to be able to write whatever they would like for their
workouts and to allow them to track their workouts by date.

An unresolved issue is that the text data fields do not display any text past
the first space, and I'm not sure how to fix this bug.  You will see it
when you display your workouts and pay special attention to the description
and notes fields.  For example, if you write in the description "Walked a mile",
you will only see "Walked" when you view your past workouts.
